# to use:
After following the instructions in main.py to input your own private data, have the Nox Assistant shortcut (but not the Nox Player one) visible on your screen, and run main.py. Nox Assistant must also be in the Game Launcher view, not the Multi-Drive Manager view. Note that the game and/or Nox Assistant can be already running when you start the program--as long as the Nox Assistant icon is visible.
